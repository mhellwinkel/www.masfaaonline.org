### About the blog

Hello MASFAA Colleagues and welcome to the RMASFAA Exchange!

Social media outlets are revolutionizing how people communicate and get news. The Association News Committee (a collaborative working group made up of representation from each state in the Rocky Mountain region) is responsible for coordinating the preparation and presentation of association news via the Exchange Blog and RMASFAA list-serve. Thus, the committee plans to maintain the blog to provide important news and information to our members. This will allow us to distribute information and news to our members on a more regular basis - and in a more relevant manner.

If you haven’t already, we encourage you to **subscribe** to [The Exchange Blog](http://rmasfaa.wordpress.com) to receive up-to-date information about all things RMASFAA. Subscribing is easy:
